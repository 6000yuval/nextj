<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why AI Helps in Investing (and Where It Should Not)</h3>
<p>
  Investing is 80 percent research and discipline, 20 percent decision. AI is great at the research side: summarizing documents, extracting key
  risks, comparing competitors, and organizing notes. It is terrible at predicting markets, future prices, or “guaranteed returns.” If you use AI
  as a research assistant, you get speed and clarity. If you use it as a crystal ball, you get false confidence.
</p>
<p>
  The goal is not to let AI decide. The goal is to reduce the time you spend gathering information so you can spend more time thinking. That is
  the edge most investors actually lack.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 6-Step AI Investing Workflow</h3>
<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Define the thesis.</strong> Write your investment question in one sentence.</li>
  <li><strong>Collect primary sources.</strong> Use official filings, earnings calls, annual reports, and investor presentations.</li>
  <li><strong>Summarize with structure.</strong> Ask AI to extract risks, growth drivers, and cash flow signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-check.</strong> Compare AI output to the original docs and correct errors.</li>
  <li><strong>Write a decision memo.</strong> Summarize your thesis, evidence, and counter-arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Set a review schedule.</strong> Revisit assumptions on a fixed calendar.</li>
</ol>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Thesis First, Not Last</h3>
<p>
  The most common mistake is asking AI for “everything.” That produces a long, unfocused summary. Instead, define the question:
  “Is this company growing revenue while expanding margins?” or “Will this market expand faster than competitors?” Give the AI a thesis framework
  so it filters the data the same way you would.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Use Primary Sources</h3>
<p>
  AI summaries are only as good as the data you feed them. Use original filings and earnings transcripts. When you give the AI a blog post about
  a company, it will repeat the blog’s bias. When you give it a 10-K, it will extract real disclosures. This is how you avoid misinformation.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Ask the Right Questions</h3>
<div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-blue-200">
  <p className="font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Example prompt structure</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-blue-800 space-y-1">
    <li>Extract the top 5 risks mentioned in the filing.</li>
    <li>List the main revenue drivers and what could slow them down.</li>
    <li>Identify any changes in guidance or forward-looking statements.</li>
    <li>Summarize capital allocation plans in plain English.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
  Notice how these prompts are about evidence, not predictions. You can also ask for a neutral “bear case” summary, which forces the AI to look
  for negative signals. That reduces confirmation bias.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Build a Decision Memo</h3>
<p>
  The decision memo is the most valuable output of your process. It should include your thesis, the supporting evidence, the main risks, and the
  conditions under which you would change your mind. This turns the AI’s output into a tool for discipline. Without a memo, you will forget why
  you invested and panic during volatility.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Use AI for Monitoring, Not Trading</h3>
<p>
  AI can track news, scan for changes in guidance, or detect changes in sentiment. But it should not execute trades. Automated trading requires
  strict risk controls, compliance, and testing. For most investors, AI should be a monitoring assistant, not a trading engine.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Pitfalls</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
  <li>Asking AI to predict prices or “best stocks.”</li>
  <li>Using AI summaries without checking the source documents.</li>
  <li>Ignoring the bear case because the AI sounds confident.</li>
  <li>Letting AI decide position sizes or portfolio allocation.</li>
  <li>Forgetting that markets change faster than static research.</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Final Takeaway</h3>
<p>
  AI can make your investing research faster, more organized, and less overwhelming. But the decision still belongs to you. Use AI to highlight
  evidence, pressure-test your thesis, and keep your process consistent. That is how you get real value without the illusion of certainty.
