  <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-900 mb-2">The Revenue Team Problem</h3>
  <p className="text-purple-800 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
    Sales and marketing teams are buried in research, list cleaning, and content drafts. AI can shorten the path from lead to qualified
    conversation if you use it in the right places.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Where AI Delivers the Highest ROI</h3>
<p>
  The biggest gains come from tasks that are repetitive, research-heavy, and time-consuming. AI can summarize accounts, create persona-based
  messaging, and highlight patterns in campaign performance. The human still owns strategy and relationship building, but the groundwork gets done
  faster.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Use Cases That Actually Convert</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
  <li>Account research summaries before discovery calls.</li>
  <li>First-draft outreach emails based on persona and industry.</li>
  <li>Campaign post-mortems that explain what worked and why.</li>
  <li>Lead routing based on fit, urgency, and deal size.</li>
  <li>FAQ and objection handling scripts for SDRs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">A Simple AI Outreach Framework</h3>
<p>
  Give the AI constraints so it cannot ramble. A good outreach message is short, specific, and respectful. Provide the target role, company size,
  value proposition, and a single clear CTA. The AI can then produce five variations for A/B testing.
</p>
<div className="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-slate-200">
  <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
    “Draft 3 outreach emails to a VP of Operations at a 200-person SaaS company. Focus on reducing onboarding time. Tone: confident, brief, not pushy.
    Include one data point and a 15-minute meeting CTA.”
  </p>
</div>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Do Not Automate Relationships</h3>
<p>
  AI should assist with preparation, not replace real conversations. If your outreach feels automated, response rates fall. Use AI to draft, then
  personalize with a real observation. That balance creates authenticity at scale.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Metrics to Track</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
  <li>Response rate and meeting conversion.</li>
  <li>Time-to-first-touch after lead creation.</li>
  <li>Pipeline velocity and deal cycle length.</li>
  <li>Content production time per campaign.</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Final Takeaway</h3>
<p>
  AI can accelerate sales and marketing ops, but it cannot replace trust. Use it to do the busy work, keep humans focused on relationships, and
  you will see better pipeline speed without damaging your brand.
