  <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">Finance Teams Are Drowning in Manual Work</h3>
  <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
    Most finance teams spend more time preparing reports than analyzing them. AI can flip that ratio by drafting narratives, explaining variances,
    and organizing data for faster review.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Where AI Creates Real Value in Finance</h3>
<p>
  Finance workflows are structured, repeatable, and governed by strict rules. That makes them ideal for AI assistance, especially in three areas:
  narrative reporting, variance explanations, and consolidation of cross-team inputs. AI should not replace accounting judgment, but it can reduce
  the time spent on formatting and first drafts.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Use Cases That Save Hours</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
  <li>Drafting monthly close summaries from a standard template.</li>
  <li>Explaining budget vs. actual variances in plain English.</li>
  <li>Summarizing departmental updates into an executive report.</li>
  <li>Creating meeting agendas and follow-up action lists.</li>
  <li>Extracting key risks from supplier contracts or invoices.</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">A Safe AI Workflow for Finance</h3>
<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Clean inputs:</strong> Provide structured tables or consistent exports.</li>
  <li><strong>Defined outputs:</strong> Use a standard report template every time.</li>
  <li><strong>Human review:</strong> A finance lead validates numbers and narrative.</li>
  <li><strong>Audit trail:</strong> Store inputs and outputs for compliance.</li>
</ol>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Sample Variance Prompt</h3>
<div className="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-slate-200">
  <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
    “You are drafting a variance explanation for the monthly close. Use the provided table. Focus on revenue, gross margin, and operating expenses.
    Explain the top three drivers, quantify impact, and avoid speculation. Output in three bullet points.”
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  This is the kind of constrained prompt that produces consistent, reviewable output. The AI does not need to “think like a CFO.” It just needs
  to format the data clearly so the CFO can make decisions.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Risk Controls You Must Keep</h3>
<p>
  Finance is high-stakes. Do not allow AI to post journal entries, approve payments, or change records. AI should draft and summarize, not execute.
  Make sure sensitive data is protected, access is logged, and outputs are reviewed by qualified staff.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Final Takeaway</h3>
<p>
  Finance teams do not need “more AI.” They need less manual work and clearer reporting. Use AI to draft, summarize, and standardize. Keep humans
  in charge of judgment and compliance. That balance delivers speed without sacrificing trust.
