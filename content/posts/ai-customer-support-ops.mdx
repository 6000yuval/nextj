  <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">The Support Reality</h3>
  <p className="text-green-800 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
    Customers do not want “AI.” They want fast, accurate answers. The best support systems use AI for drafting and triage while keeping humans
    responsible for empathy, exceptions, and final approval.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Support Is a Perfect AI Use Case</h3>
<p>
  Support is repetitive, high-volume, and full of structured policy. That is exactly where AI shines. A model can read policies, past tickets,
  and product docs, then propose a response in seconds. The human agent edits the final message, adds empathy, and handles edge cases. This hybrid
  approach can cut response time by 30 to 60 percent without making customers feel like they are talking to a robot.
</p>
<p>
  The key is to make AI invisible to the customer and helpful to the agent. When the AI is treated as a teammate instead of a replacement,
  support teams get faster and happier.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 4-Part Support Workflow</h3>
<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Triage:</strong> Classify the ticket, detect urgency, and route to the right queue.</li>
  <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Produce a response that follows policy and brand tone.</li>
  <li><strong>Review:</strong> Human agent checks accuracy and empathy, then edits.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Log mistakes and update the knowledge base.</li>
</ol>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">What to Automate First</h3>
<p>
  Start with the top 20 percent of ticket types that make up 80 percent of volume. These are usually billing questions, password resets,
  account changes, and simple how-to requests. Create templates for each type and ask the AI to fill them based on the ticket content and policy
  references. This makes review fast and consistent.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Protecting Brand Voice</h3>
<p>
  AI outputs should sound like your company, not a generic assistant. Provide a short brand voice guide: tone, formality, banned phrases, and
  required closing lines. If your company is casual, say it. If your company is formal, say it. The AI will follow direction when it is clear.

  <p className="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Brand voice checklist</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
    <li>Friendly, concise, no jargon.</li>
    <li>Always confirm the customer’s goal.</li>
    <li>Never promise refunds without policy confirmation.</li>
    <li>End with one clear next step.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Handling Sensitive Cases</h3>
<p>
  AI should never close tickets involving legal threats, compliance, security incidents, or emotional distress. These must be routed to human
  specialists. Your workflow should include a “red flag” detection layer that automatically escalates those tickets.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Metrics That Matter</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
  <li>First response time (minutes saved).</li>
  <li>Resolution time (overall efficiency).</li>
  <li>Customer satisfaction score (quality impact).</li>
  <li>Escalation rate (risk control).</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Final Takeaway</h3>
<p>
  AI in support is not about replacing agents. It is about removing the boring parts so agents can focus on real customer care. Start small,
  measure quality, and expand only when trust is proven. That is how you get speed without losing loyalty.
